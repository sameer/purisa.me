Many large open-source software projects use automated processes for examining code.
These serve to ensure:

* Consistent, reproducible test runs prior to release
* Publicly available test line/branch coverage reports
* Insight into dependency security advisories (i.e. [actions-rs/audit-check](https://github.com/actions-rs/audit-check))
* Baseline expectations for community contributions (if it doesn't pass, it doesn't get merged! :shrug:)
* ...and any other computable function!

For projects written in a hardware description language (HDL), it's quite a different story[^1].
These processes often run locally at the developer's discretion, are locked away in private continuous integration (CI) servers,
or just don't occur at all.

But not to worry, that doesn't mean there isn't a way to hold your projects to a higher standard! Below I describe the setup used by [hdl-util/hdmi](https://github.com/hdl-util/hdmi), where testbenches are run using [hdlmake](https://hdlmake.readthedocs.io/en/master/) + [ModelSim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModelSim) in [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

First, make sure you've set up hdlmake `Manifest.py`'s for your testbench and a `.do` file for ModelSim to run:

1. In `./test/top_tb/Manifest.py`
    ```python
    files = [
        # SystemVerilog testbench for the top module.
        "top_tb.sv"
    ]

    # Include the top module so the testbench's use of it is found in ModelSim
    modules = {
    "local" : [ "../../top/" ],
    }
    ```
1. In `./sim/top_tb/Manifest.py`
    ```python
    action = "simulation"
    sim_tool = "modelsim"
    sim_top = "top_tb"

    sim_post_cmd = "vsim -do ../vsim.do -c top_tb"

    modules = {
        "local" : [ "../../test/top_tb" ],
    }
    ```
    * The testbench module is named `top_tb`
1. In `./sim/vsim.do`
    ```tcl
    onfinish stop
    run -all
    if { [runStatus -full] == "break simulation_stop {\$finish}" } {
        echo Build succeeded
        quit -f -code 0
    } else {
        echo Build failed with status [runStatus -full]
        quit -f -code 1
    }
    ```
    * NOTE: the quit code here is important. A non-zero exit code is necessary to tell GH actions that the tests failed.
      For my purposes, the tests fail if the simulation ended early because a hard assertion failed. Make sure to set this up properly if you have a different use case or it might look like the tests are always passing.

Here's what the GitHub Actions workflow looks like:

```yaml
name: testbench run

# Runs when code is pushed to a branch or a pull request is created
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    # At the time of writing, this is Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver but will be 20.04 Focal Fossa in the near future.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

        with:

        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: $HOME/intelFPGA

Hopefully that comes in handy for you or another reader. Feel free to [reach out](/about) if you have any questions.
